Using the *language* you are most comfortable with, you need to write an application. You will be writing an application that prints out information to a user.

## Details

- For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number.
- For multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”
